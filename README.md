# DemonstrateProjects
Project made in order to demonstrate your own projects in a simple way. The backend is in C#, and the frontend is an angular app. Some concepts:
 - xUnit for Unit tests.
 - Moq for helping the above.
 - EF Core as a good way to manage data.
 - Postgresql as a good database language.
 - REST as a simple pattern for a simple app.
 - JWT Bearer as a good authorization method for the above pattern.
 - Clean Architecture as a good way to describe and organize the whole backend system.
 - A responsive design for all screens.
